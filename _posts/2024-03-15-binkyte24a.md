abstract: Differential privacy is a widely adopted framework designed to safeguard
  the sensitive information of data providers within a data set. It is based on the
  application of controlled noise at the interface between the server that stores
  and processes the data, and the data consumers. Local differential privacy is a
  variant that allows data providers to apply the privatization mechanism themselves
  on their data individually. Therefore, it provides protection also in contexts in
  which the server, or even the data collector, cannot be trusted. The introduction
  of noise, however, inevitably affects the utility of the data, particularly by distorting
  the correlations between individual data components. This distortion can prove detrimental
  to tasks such as causal structure learning. In this paper, we consider various well-known
  locally differentially private mechanisms and compare the trade-off between the
  privacy they provide, and the accuracy of the causal structure produced by algorithms
  for causal learning when applied to data obfuscated by these mechanisms. Our analysis
  yields valuable insights for selecting appropriate local differentially private
  protocols for causal discovery tasks. We foresee that our findings will aid researchers
  and practitioners in conducting locally private causal discovery.
