abstract: We present a causality-inspired adjusted plus-minus model for evaluating
  individual players from their performance on a team. We take an explicitly causal
  approach to this problem, defining the value of a player to be the expected change
  in the score had we substituted the player for one who has zero value. (This quantity
  is “causal” in the sense that it is an inference about a hypothetical intervention.)
  We adapt recent ideas of factor modeling to handle the indirectly measured confounding
  in estimating player values, considering each player to be a “treatment” who contributes
  to the outcome of the game. We demonstrate the behavior of the model on data about
  soccer and basketball.
