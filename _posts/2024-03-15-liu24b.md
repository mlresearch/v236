abstract: Estimating the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational
  data is challenging due to the super-exponential growth of the search space with
  the number of nodes. Previous research primarily focuses on identifying a unique
  DAG under specific model constraints in linear or nonlinear scenarios. However,
  real-world scenarios often involve causal mechanisms with a mixture of linear and
  nonlinear characteristics, which has received limited attention in existing literature.
  Due to unidentifiability, existing algorithms relying on fully identifiable conditions
  may produce erroneous results. Although traditional methods like the PC algorithm
  can be employed to uncover such graphs, they typically yield only a Markov equivalence
  class. This paper introduces a novel causal discovery approach that extends beyond
  the Markov equivalence class, aiming to uncover as many edge directions as possible
  when the causal graph is not fully identifiable. Our approach exploits the second
  derivative of the log-likelihood in observational data, harnessing scalable machine
  learning approaches to approximate the score function. Overall, our approach demonstrates
  competitive accuracy comparable to current state-of-the-art techniques while offering
  a significant improvement in computational speed.
