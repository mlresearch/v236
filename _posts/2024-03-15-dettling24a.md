abstract: Graphical continuous Lyapunov models offer a new perspective on modeling
  causally interpretable dependence structure in multivariate data by treating each
  independent observation as a one-time cross-sectional snapshot of a temporal process.
  Specifically, the models assume that the observations are cross-sections of independent
  multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in equilibrium. The Gaussian equilibrium
  exists under a stability assumption on the drift matrix, and the equilibrium covariance
  matrix is determined by the continuous Lyapunov equation. Each graphical continuous
  Lyapunov model assumes the drift matrix to be sparse, with a support determined
  by a directed graph. A natural approach to model selection in this setting is to
  use an $\ell_1$-regularization technique that, based on a given sample covariance
  matrix, seeks to find a sparse approximate solution to the Lyapunov equation. We
  study the model selection properties of the resulting lasso technique to arrive
  at a consistency result.  Our detailed analysis reveals that the involved irrepresentability
  condition is surprisingly difficult to satisfy. While this may prevent asymptotic
  consistency in model selection, our numerical experiments indicate that even if
  the theoretical requirements for consistency are not met, the lasso approach is
  able to recover relevant structure of the drift matrix and is robust to aspects
  of model misspecification.
