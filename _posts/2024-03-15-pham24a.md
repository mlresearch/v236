abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the counterfactual joint distribution
  of multiple quantities of interests (e.g., outcomes) in a multivariate causal model
  extended from the classical difference-in-difference design. Existing methods for
  this task either ignore the correlation structures among dimensions of the multivariate
  outcome by considering univariate causal models on each dimension separately and
  hence produce incorrect counterfactual distributions, or poorly scale even for moderate-size
  datasets when directly dealing with such a multivariate causal model. We propose
  a method that alleviates both issues simultaneously by leveraging a robust latent
  one-dimensional subspace of the original high-dimension space and exploiting the
  efficient estimation from the univariate causal model on such space. Since the construction
  of the one-dimensional subspace uses information from all the dimensions, our method
  can capture the correlation structures and produce good estimates of the counterfactual
  distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing methods
  on both synthetic and real-world data.
