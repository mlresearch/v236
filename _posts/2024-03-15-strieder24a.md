abstract: 'Knowledge of the underlying causal relations is essential for inferring
  the effect of interventions in complex systems. In a widely studied approach, structural
  causal models postulate noisy functional relations among interacting variables,
  where the underlying causal structure is then naturally represented by a directed
  graph whose edges indicate direct causal dependencies. In the typical application,
  this underlying causal structure must be learned from data, and thus, the remaining
  structure uncertainty needs to be incorporated into causal inference in order to
  draw reliable conclusions. In recent work, test inversions provide an ansatz to
  account for this data-driven model choice and, therefore, combine structure learning
  with causal inference. In this article, we propose the use of dual likelihood to
  greatly simplify the treatment of the involved testing problem. Indeed, dual likelihood
  leads to a closed-form solution for constructing confidence regions for total causal
  effects that rigorously capture both sources of uncertainty: causal structure and
  numerical size of nonzero effects. The proposed confidence regions can be computed
  with a bottom-up procedure starting from sink nodes. To render the causal structure
  identifiable, we develop our ideas in the context of linear causal relations with
  equal error variances.'
