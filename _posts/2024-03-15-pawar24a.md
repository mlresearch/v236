abstract: In the context of Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI),
  the concepts of sufficiency and necessity of features offer nuanced perspectives
  on the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a model’s outputs. These concepts
  are, therefore, essential in Explainable AI (XAI) as they can provide a more holistic
  understanding of a “black-box" AI model. Addressing this need, our study explored
  the relationships between the XAI’s explanations and the sufficiency and necessity
  of features in data. This is achieved by emphasising the impact of neighbourhoods,
  which are central in generating explanations. By analysing a diverse set of neighbourhoods,
  we highlighted how they influence the alignment between the feature rankings by
  XAI and the measures of sufficiency and necessity. This work offers two contributions.
  First, it provides a comprehensive discussion on how XAI frameworks relate to sufficiency
  and necessity with respect to their operating neighbourhoods; and second, it empirically
  demonstrates the effectiveness of these neighbourhoods in conveying the sufficiency
  and necessity of features by the XAI frameworks.
