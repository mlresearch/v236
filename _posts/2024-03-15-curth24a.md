abstract: Synthetic control (SC) methods have gained rapid popularity in economics
  recently, where they have been applied in the context of inferring the effects of
  treatments on standard continuous outcomes assuming linear input-output relations.
  In medical applications, conversely, survival outcomes are often of primary interest,
  a setup in which both commonly assumed data-generating processes (DGPs) and target
  parameters are different. In this paper, we therefore investigate whether and when
  SCs could serve as an alternative to matching methods in survival analyses. We find
  that, because SCs rely on a linearity assumption, they will generally be biased
  for the true expected survival time in commonly assumed survival DGPs – even when
  taking into account the possibility of linearity on another scale as in accelerated
  failure time models. Additionally, we find that, because SC units follow distributions
  with lower variance than real control units, summaries of their distributions, such
  as survival curves,  will be biased for the parameters of interest in many survival
  analyses. Nonetheless, we also highlight that using SCs can still improve upon matching
  whenever the biases described above are outweighed by extrapolation biases exhibited
  by imperfect matches, and investigate the use of regularization to trade off the
  shortcomings of both approaches.
