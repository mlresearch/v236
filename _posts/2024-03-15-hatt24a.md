abstract: Observational data is often used to estimate the effect of a treatment when
  randomized experiments are infeasible or costly. However, observational data often
  yields biased estimates of treatment effects, since treatment assignment can be
  confounded by unobserved variables. A remedy is offered by deconfounding methods
  that adjust for such unobserved confounders. In this paper, we develop the Sequential
  Deconfounder, a method that enables estimating individualized treatment effects
  over time in presence of unobserved confounders. This is the first deconfounding
  method that can be used with a single treatment assigned at each timestep. The Sequential
  Deconfounder uses a novel Gaussian process latent variable model to infer substitutes
  for the unobserved confounders, which are then used in conjunction with an outcome
  model to estimate treatment effects over time. We prove that using our method yields
  unbiased estimates of individualized treatment responses over time. Using simulated
  and real medical data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in deconfounding
  the estimation of treatment responses over time.
