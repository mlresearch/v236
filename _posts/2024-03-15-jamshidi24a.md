abstract: We study the problem of learning "good" interventions in a stochastic environment
  modeled by its underlying causal graph. Good interventions refer to interventions
  that maximize rewards. Specifically, we consider the setting of a pre-specified
  budget constraint, where interventions can have non-uniform costs.  We show that
  this problem can be formulated as maximizing the expected reward for a stochastic
  multi-armed bandit with side information.  We propose an algorithm to minimize the
  cumulative regret in general causal graphs. This algorithm trades off observations
  and interventions based on their costs to achieve the optimal reward.  This algorithm
  generalizes the state-of-the-art methods by allowing non-uniform costs and hidden
  confounders in the causal graph. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm to minimize
  the simple regret in the budgeted setting with non-uniform costs and also general
  causal graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees, including both upper and lower
  bounds, as well as empirical evaluations of our algorithms. Our empirical results
  showcase that our algorithms outperform the state of the art.
