abstract: Causal discovery outputs a causal structure, represented by a graph, from
  observed data. For time series data, there is a variety of methods, however, it
  is difficult to evaluate these on real data as realistic use cases very rarely come
  with a known causal graph to which output can be compared. In this paper, we present
  a dataset from an industrial subsystem at the European Spallation Source along with
  its causal graph which has been constructed from expert knowledge. This provides
  a testbed for causal discovery from time series observations of complex systems,
  and we believe this can help inform the development of causal discovery methodology.
