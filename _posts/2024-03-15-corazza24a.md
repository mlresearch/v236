abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal policies
  for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex sequence of events
  in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are finite-state formalisms
  that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward signal, along with nondeterministic
  task outcomes. While special RL algorithms can exploit this finite-state structure
  to expedite learning, PRMs remain difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders
  the already difficult tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment,
  and transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
  structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
  in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism, thereby
  expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task specifications to new
  environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result about convergence to
  optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its strengths empirically.
