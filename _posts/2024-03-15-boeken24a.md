abstract: 'When predicting a target variable $Y$ from features $X$, the prediction
  $\hat{Y}$ can be performative: an agent might act on this prediction, affecting
  the value of $Y$ that we eventually observe. Performative predictions are deliberately
  prevalent in algorithmic decision support, where a decision support system (DSS)
  provides a prediction for an agent to affect the value of the target variable. When
  deploying a DSS in high-stakes settings (e.g. healthcare, law, predictive policing,
  or child welfare screening) it is imperative to carefully assess the performative
  effects of the DSS. In the case that the DSS serves as an alarm for a predicted
  negative outcome, naive retraining of the prediction model is bound to result in
  a model that underestimates the risk, due to effective workings of the previous
  model. In this work, we propose to model the deployment of a DSS as causal domain
  shift and provide novel cross-domain identification results for the conditional
  expectation $E[Y|X]$, allowing for pre- and post-hoc assessment of the deployment
  of the DSS, and for re-training of a model that assesses the risk under a baseline
  policy where the DSS is not deployed. Using a running example, we empirically show
  that a repeated regression procedure provides a practical framework for estimating
  these quantities, even when the data is affected by sample selection bias and selective
  labelling, offering for a practical, unified solution for multiple forms of target
  variable bias.'
