abstract: Causal inference of exact individual treatment outcomes in the presence
  of hidden confounders is rarely possible. Recent work has extended prediction intervals
  with finite-sample guarantees to partially identifiable causal outcomes, by means
  of a sensitivity model for hidden confounding. In deep learning, predictors can
  exploit their inductive biases for better generalization out of sample. We argue
  that the structure inherent to a deep ensemble should inform a tighter partial identification
  of the causal outcomes that they predict. We therefore introduce an approach termed
  <b>Caus-Modens</b>, for characterizing <b>caus</b>al outcome intervals by <b>mod</b>ulated
  <b>ens</b>embles. We present a simple approach to partial identification using existing
  causal sensitivity models and show empirically that Caus-Modens gives tighter outcome
  intervals, as measured by the necessary interval size to achieve sufficient coverage.
  The last of our three diverse benchmarks is a novel usage of GPT-4 for observational
  experiments with unknown but probeable ground truth.
