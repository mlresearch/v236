abstract: Recent developments enable the quantification of causal control given a
  structural causal model (SCM). This has been accomplished by introducing quantities
  which encode changes in the entropy of one variable when  intervening on another.
  These measures, named causal entropy and causal information gain, aim to address
  limitations in existing information theoretical approaches for machine learning
  tasks where causality plays a crucial role. They have not yet been properly mathematically
  studied. Our research contributes to the formal understanding of the notions of
  causal entropy and causal information gain by establishing and analyzing fundamental
  properties of these concepts, including bounds and chain rules. Furthermore, we
  elucidate the relationship between causal entropy and stochastic interventions.
  We also propose definitions for causal conditional entropy and causal conditional
  information gain. Overall, this exploration paves the way for enhancing causal machine
  learning tasks through the study of recently-proposed information theoretic quantities
  grounded in considerations about causality.
