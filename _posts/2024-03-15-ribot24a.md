abstract: We consider the task of <em>causal imputation</em>, where we aim to predict
  the outcomes of some set of actions across a wide range of possible contexts. As
  a running example, we consider predicting how different drugs affect cells from
  different cell types. We study the index-only setting, where the actions and contexts
  are categorical variables with a finite number of possible values. Even in this
  simple setting, a practical challenge arises, since often only a small subset of
  possible action-context pairs have been studied. Thus, models must extrapolate to
  novel action-context pairs, which can be framed as a form of matrix completion with
  rows indexed by actions, columns indexed by contexts, and matrix entries corresponding
  to outcomes. We introduce a novel SCM-based model class, where the outcome is expressed
  as a counterfactual, actions are expressed as interventions on an instrumental variable,
  and contexts are defined based on the initial state of the system. We show that,
  under a linearity assumption, this setup induces a <em>latent factor model</em>
  over the matrix of outcomes, with an additional fixed effect term. To perform causal
  prediction based on this model class, we introduce simple extension to the Synthetic
  Interventions estimator (Agarwal et al., 2020). We evaluate several matrix completion
  approaches on the PRISM drug repurposing dataset, showing that our method outperforms
  all other considered matrix completion approaches.
