abstract: Causal abstraction (CA) theory establishes formal criteria for relating
  multiple structural causal models (SCMs) at different levels of granularity by defining
  maps between them. These maps have significant relevance for real-world challenges
  such as synthesizing causal evidence from multiple experimental environments, learning
  causally consistent representations at different resolutions, and linking interventions
  across multiple SCMs. In this work, we propose COTA, the first method to learn abstraction
  maps from observational and interventional data without assuming complete knowledge
  of the underlying SCMs. In particular, we introduce a multi-marginal Optimal Transport
  (OT) formulation that enforces do-calculus causal constraints, together with a cost
  function that relies on interventional information. We extensively evaluate COTA
  on synthetic and real world problems, and showcase its advantages over non-causal,
  independent and aggregated OT formulations. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency
  of our method as a data augmentation tool by comparing it against prior art of CA
  learning, which assumes fully specified SCMs, on a real-world downstream task.
