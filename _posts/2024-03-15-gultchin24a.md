abstract: 'We introduce a causal framework for designing optimal policies that satisfy
  classes of fairness constraints. We take a pragmatic approach asking what we can
  do with an action space available from historical data, with no further experimentation
  and novel actions immediately available. We propose two different fairness constraints:
  a "moderation breaking" constraint which aims at reducing disparity in outcome levels
  across sensitive attributes to the extent the provided action space permits; and
  an "equal benefit" constraint which aims at distributing gain from the new and maximized
  policy equally across sensitive attribute levels, and thus at keeping pre-existing
  preferential treatment in place or avoiding the introduction of new disparity. We
  introduce practical methods for implementing the constraints and illustrate their
  uses on experiments with semi-synthetic models.'
