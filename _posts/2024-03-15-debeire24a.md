abstract: Learning causal graphs from multivariate time series is an ubiquitous challenge
  in all application domains dealing with time-dependent systems, such as in Earth
  sciences, biology, or engineering, to name a few. Recent developments for this causal
  discovery learning task have shown considerable skill, notably the specific time-series
  adaptations of the popular conditional independence-based learning framework. However,
  uncertainty estimation is challenging for conditional independence- based methods.
  Here, we introduce a novel bootstrap approach designed for time series causal discovery
  that preserves the temporal dependencies and lag-structure. It can be combined with
  a range of time series causal discovery methods and provides a measure of confidence
  for the links of the time series graphs. Furthermore, next to confidence estimation,
  an aggregation, also called bagging, of the bootstrapped graphs by majority voting
  results in bagged causal discovery methods. In this work, we combine this approach
  with the state-of-the-art conditional-independence-based algorithm PCMCI+. With
  extensive numerical experiments we empirically demonstrate that, in addition to
  providing confidence measures for links, Bagged-PCMCI+ improves in precision and
  recall as compared to its base algorithm PCMCI+, at the cost of higher computational
  demands. These statistical performance improvements are especially pronounced in
  the more challenging settings (short time sample size, large number of variables,
  high autocorrelation). Our bootstrap approach can also be combined with other time
  series causal discovery algorithms and can be of considerable use in many real-world
  applications.
