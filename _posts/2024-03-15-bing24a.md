abstract: The task of inferring high-level causal variables from low-level observations,
  commonly referred to as <em>causal representation learning</em>, is fundamentally
  underconstrained. As such, recent works to address this problem focus on various
  assumptions that lead to identifiability of the underlying latent causal variables.
  A large corpus of these preceding approaches consider multi-environment data collected
  under different interventions on the causal model. What is common to virtually all
  of these works is the restrictive assumption that in each environment, only a single
  variable is intervened on. In this work, we relax this assumption and provide the
  first identifiability result for causal representation learning that allows for
  multiple variables to be targeted by an intervention within one environment. Our
  approach hinges on a general assumption on the coverage and diversity of interventions
  across environments, which also includes the shared assumption of single-node interventions
  of previous works. The main idea behind our approach is to exploit the trace that
  interventions leave on the variance of the ground truth causal variables and regularizing
  for a specific notion of sparsity with respect to this trace. In addition to and
  inspired by our theoretical contributions, we present a practical algorithm to learn
  causal representations from multi-node interventional data and provide empirical
  evidence that validates our identifiability results.
