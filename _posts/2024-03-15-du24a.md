abstract: We study the data-generating mechanism for reconstructive SSL to shed light
  on its effectiveness. With an infinite amount of labeled samples, we provide a sufficient
  and necessary condition for perfect linear approximation. The condition reveals
  a full-rank component that preserves the label classes of $Y$, along with a redundant
  component. Motivated by the condition, we propose to approximate the redundant component
  by a low-rank factorization and measure the approximation quality by introducing
  a new measure, $\epsilon_s$, parameterized by the rank of factorization $s$. We
  incorporate $\epsilon_s$ into the excess risk analysis under both linear regression
  and ridge regression settings, where the latter regularization approach is to handle
  scenarios when the dimension of the learned features is much larger than the number
  of labeled samples $n$ for downstream tasks. We design two stylized experiments
  to compare SSL with supervised learning (SL) under different settings to support
  our theoretical findings.
