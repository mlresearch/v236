abstract: "“Treatment-confounder feedback” is the central complication to resolve
  in longitudinal studies, to infer causality. The existing frameworks of identifying
  causal effects for longitudinal studies with repeated measures hinge heavily on
  assuming that time advances in discrete time steps or data change as a jumping process,
  rendering the number of “feedbacks” finite. However, medical studies nowadays with
  real-time monitoring involve functional time-varying outcomes, treatment, and confounders,
  which leads to an uncountably infinite number of “feedbacks”. Therefore more general
  and advanced theory is needed. We generalize the definition of causal effects under
  user-specified stochastic treatment regimes to functional longitudinal studies with
  continuous monitoring and develop an identification framework for a end-of-study
  outcome. We provide sufficient identification assumptions including a generalized
  consistency assumption, a sequential randomization assumption, a positivity assumption,
  and a novel “intervenable” assumption designed for the continuous-time case. Under
  these assumptions, we propose a g-computation process and an inverse probability
  weighting process, which suggest a g-computation formula and an inverse probability
  weighting formula for identification. For practical purposes, we also construct
  two classes of population estimating equations to identify these two processes,
  respectively, which further suggest a doubly robust identification formula with
  extra robustness against process misspecification."
