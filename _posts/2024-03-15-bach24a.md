abstract: Proper hyperparameter tuning is essential for achieving optimal performance
  of modern machine learning (ML) methods in predictive tasks. While there is an extensive
  literature on tuning ML learners for prediction, there is only littleguidance available
  on tuning ML learners for causal machine learning. In this paper, we investigate
  the role of hyperparameter tuning and other practical decisions for causal estimation
  as based on the Double Machine Learning approach by Chernozhukov et al.Â (2018).
  Double Machine Learning relies on estimating so-called nuisance parameters by treating
  them as supervised learning problems and using them as plug-in estimates to solve
  for the (causal) parameter. We conduct an extensive simulation study using data
  from the 2019 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference Data Challenge. We provide empirical
  insights on the selection and calibration of the ML methods for the performance
  of causal estimation. First, we assess the importance of data splitting schemes
  for tuning ML learners within Double Machine Learning. Second, we investigate the
  choice of ML methods and hyperparameters, including recent AutoML frameworks, and
  consider the relationship between their predictive power and the estimation performance
  for a causal parameter of interest. Third, we investigate to what extent the choice
  of a particular causal model, as characterized by incorporated parametric assumptions,
  can be based on predictive performance metrics.
