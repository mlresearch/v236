abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover information about an unobserved causal
  graph from the observable data it generates. Layerings are orderings of the variables
  which place causes before effects. In this paper, we provide ways to recover layerings
  of a graph by accessing the data via a conditional entropy oracle, when distributions
  are discrete. Our algorithms work by repeatedly removing sources or sinks from the
  graph. Under appropriate assumptions and conditioning, we can separate the sources
  or sinks from the remainder of the nodes by comparing their conditional entropy
  to the unconditional entropy of their noise. Our algorithms are provably correct
  and run in worst-case quadratic time. The main assumptions are faithfulness and
  injective noise, and either known noise entropies or weakly monotonically increasing
  noise entropies along directed paths. In addition, we require one of either a very
  mild extension of faithfulness, or strictly monotonically increasing noise entropies,
  or expanding noise injectivity to include an additional single argument in the structural
  functions.
