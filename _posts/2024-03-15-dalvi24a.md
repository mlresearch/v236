abstract: Matching is one of the simplest approaches for estimating causal effects
  from observational data. Matching techniques compare the observed outcomes across
  pairs of individuals with similar covariate values but different treatment statuses
  in order to estimate causal effects. However, traditional matching techniques are
  unreliable given high-dimensional covariates due to the infamous curse of dimensionality.
  To overcome this challenge, we propose a simple, fast, yet highly effective approach
  to matching using Random Hyperplane Tessellations (RHPT). First, we prove that the
  RHPT representation is an approximate balancing score – thus maintaining the strong
  ignorability assumption – and provide empirical evidence for this claim. Second,
  we report results of extensive experiments showing that matching using RHPT outperforms
  traditional matching techniques and is competitive with state-of-the-art deep learning
  methods for causal effect estimation. In addition, RHPT avoids the need for computationally
  expensive training of deep neural networks.
