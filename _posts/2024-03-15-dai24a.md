abstract: 'Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have offered an exciting
  opportunity to discover putative causal genes or risk factors associated with diseases
  by using SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs). However, conventional approaches
  assume linear causal relations partly for simplicity and partly for the availability
  of GWAS summary data. In this work, we propose a novel model for transcriptome-wide
  association studies (TWAS) to incorporate nonlinear relationships across IVs, an
  exposure/gene, and an outcome, which is robust against violations of the valid IV
  assumptions, permits the use of GWAS summary data, and covers two-stage least squares
  (2SLS) as a special case.  We decouple the estimation of a marginal causal effect
  and a nonlinear transformation, where the former is estimated via sliced inverse
  regression and a sparse instrumental variable regression, and the latter is estimated
  by a ratio-adjusted inverse regression. On this ground, we propose an inferential
  procedure. An application of the proposed method to the ADNI gene expression data
  and the IGAP GWAS summary data identifies 18 causal genes associated with Alzheimerâ€™s
  disease, including APOE and TOMM40, in addition to 7 other genes missed by 2SLS
  considering only linear relationships. Our findings suggest that nonlinear modeling
  is required to unleash the power of IV regression for identifying potentially nonlinear
  gene-trait associations. The source code and accompanying software *nl-causal* can
