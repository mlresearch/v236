abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims at identifying high-level causal
  factors and their relationships from high-dimensional observations, e.g., images.
  While most CRL works focus on learning causal representations in a single environment,
  in this work we instead propose a first step towards learning causal representations
  from temporal sequences of images that can be adapted in a new environment, or composed
  across multiple related environments. In particular, we introduce DECAF, a framework
  that detects which causal factors can be reused and which need to be adapted from
  previously learned causal representations. Our approach is based on the availability
  of intervention targets, that indicate which variables are perturbed at each time
  step. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that integrating our framework
  with four state-of-the-art CRL approaches leads to accurate representations in a
  new environment with only a few samples.
