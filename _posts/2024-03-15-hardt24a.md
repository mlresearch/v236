abstract: Identifying root causes for unexpected or undesirable behavior in complex
  systems is a prevalent challenge. This issue becomes especially crucial in modern
  cloud applications that employ numerous microservices. Although the machine learning
  and systems research communities have proposed various techniques to tackle this
  problem, there is currently a lack of standardized datasets for quantitative benchmarking.
  Consequently, research groups are compelled to create their own datasets for experimentation.
  This paper introduces a dataset specifically designed for evaluating root cause
  analyses in microservice-based applications. The dataset encompasses latency, requests,
  and availability metrics emitted in 5-minute intervals from a distributed application.  In
  addition to normal operation metrics, the dataset includes 68 injected performance
  issues, which increase latency and reduce availability throughout the system. We
  showcase how this dataset can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a variety of methods
  spanning different causal and non-causal characterisations of the root cause analysis
  problem.  We hope the new dataset, available at https://github.com/amazon-science/petshop-root-cause-analysis,
  enables further development of techniques in this important area.
