abstract: In aggregated variables the impact of interventions is typically ill-defined
  because different micro-realizations of the same macro-intervention can result in
  different changes of downstream macro-variables. We show that this ill-definedness
  of causality on aggregated variables can turn unconfounded causal relations into
  confounded ones and vice versa, depending on the respective micro-realization. We
  argue that it is practically infeasible to only use aggregated causal systems when
  we are free from this ill-definedness.  Instead, we need to accept that macro causal
  relations are typically defined only with reference to the micro states. On the
  positive side, we show that cause-effect relations can be aggregated when the macro
  interventions are such that the distribution of micro states is the same as in the
  observational distribution; we term this natural macro interventions. We also discuss
  generalizations of this observation.
