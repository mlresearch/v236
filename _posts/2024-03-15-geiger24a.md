abstract: 'Causal abstraction is a promising theoretical framework for explainable
  artificial intelligence that defines when an interpretable high-level causal model
  is a faithful simplification of a low-level deep learning system. However, existing
  causal abstraction methods have two major limitations: they require a brute-force
  search over alignments between the high-level model and the low-level one, and they
  presuppose that variables in the high-level model will align with disjoint sets
  of neurons in the low-level one. In this paper, we present distributed alignment
  search (DAS), which overcomes these limitations. In DAS, we find the alignment between
  high-level and low-level models using gradient descent rather than conducting a
  brute-force search, and we allow individual neurons to play multiple distinct roles
  by analyzing representations in non-standard basesâ€”distributed representations.
  Our experiments show that DAS can discover internal structure that prior approaches
  miss. Overall, DAS removes previous obstacles to uncovering conceptual structure
  in trained neural nets.'
