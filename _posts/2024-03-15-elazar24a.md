abstract: What is the effect of releasing a preprint of a paper before it is submitted
  for peer review?   No randomized controlled trial has been conducted, so we turn
  to observational data to answer this question. We use data from the ICLR conference
  (2018–2022) and apply methods from causal inference to estimate the effect of arXiving
  a paper before the reviewing period (<em>early arXiving</em>) on its acceptance
  to the conference. Adjusting for confounders such as topic, authors, and quality,
  we may estimate the causal effect. However, since quality is a challenging construct
  to estimate, we use the <em>negative outcome control</em> method, using <em>paper
  citation count</em> as a control variable to debias the quality confounding effect.
  Our results suggest that early arXiving may have a small effect on a paper’s chances
  of acceptance. However, this effect (when existing) does not differ significantly
  across different groups of authors, as grouped by author citation count and institute
  rank. This suggests that early arXiving does not provide an advantage to any particular
  group.
