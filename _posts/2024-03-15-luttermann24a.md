abstract: Lifted inference exploits symmetries in probabilistic graphical models by
  using a representative for indistinguishable objects, thereby speeding up query
  answering while maintaining exact answers. Even though lifting is a well-established
  technique for the task of probabilistic inference in relational domains, it has
  not yet been applied to the task of causal inference. In this paper, we show how
  lifting can be applied to efficiently compute causal effects in relational domains.
  More specifically, we introduce parametric causal factor graphs as an extension
  of parametric factor graphs incorporating causal knowledge and give a formal semantics
  of interventions therein. We further present the lifted causal inference algorithm
  to compute causal effects on a lifted level, thereby drastically speeding up causal
  inference compared to propositional inference, e.g., in causal Bayesian networks.
  In our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
