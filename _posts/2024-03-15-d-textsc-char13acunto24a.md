abstract: The bulk of the research effort on brain connectivity revolves around statistical
  associations among brain regions, which do not directly relate to the causal mechanisms
  governing brain dynamics. Here we propose the multiscale causal backbone (MCB) of
  brain dynamics shared by a set of individuals across multiple temporal scales, and
  devise a principled methodology to extract it. Our approach leverages recent advances
  in multiscale causal structure learning and optimizes the trade-off between the
  model fitting and its complexity. Empirical assessment on synthetic data shows the
  superiority of our methodology over a baseline based on canonical functional connectivity
  networks. When applied to resting-state fMRI data, we find sparse MCBs for both
  the left and right brain hemispheres. Thanks to its multiscale nature, our approach
  shows that at low-frequency bands, causal dynamics are driven by brain regions associated
  with high-level cognitive functions; at higher frequencies instead, nodes related
  to sensory processing play a crucial role. Finally, our analysis of individualsâ€™
  multiscale causal structures confirms the existence of a causal fingerprint of brain
  connectivity, thus supporting from a causal perspective the existing extensive research
  in brain connectivity fingerprinting.
