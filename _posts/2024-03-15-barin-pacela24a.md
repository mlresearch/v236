abstract: Disentanglement  aims to recover meaningful latent ground-truth factors
  from the observed distribution solely, and is formalized through the theory of identifiability.
  The identifiability of independent latent factors is proven to be impossible in
  the unsupervised i.i.d. setting under a general nonlinear map from factors to observations.
  In this work, however, we demonstrate that it is possible to recover <em>quantized</em>
  latent factors under a generic nonlinear diffeomorphism. We only assume that the
  latent factors have <em>independent discontinuities</em> in their density, without
  requiring the factors to be statistically independent. We introduce this novel form
  of identifiability, termed <em>quantized factor identifiability</em>, and provide
  a comprehensive proof of the recovery of the quantized factors.
