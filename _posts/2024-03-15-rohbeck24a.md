abstract: While a growing number of algorithms for causal discovery of directed acyclic
  graphs from observational and interventional data have been proposed, the robust
  identification of cyclic causal graphs in particular remains an open problem. Solutions
  to this challenge would have a considerable impact in various application domains,
  including single-cell genomics, where gene regulatory networks are known to contain
  feedback loops. Recent work has shown promise to address this challenge by describing
  the expression states in a population of cells as the steady-state solution of a
  stochastic dynamical system. However, this formulation cannot account for information
  on interventions in the population, and consequently, it ignores the associated
  causal inductive biases, which are key assets to obtain meaningful results and improve
  identifiability. In this work, we propose a novel method, Bicycle, which (i) infers
  cyclic causal relationships from i.i.d. data, (ii) explicitly accounts for information
  on the perturbation state of cells by a realization of the independent causal mechanism
  principle and (iii) models causal effects in a latent space rather than on observed
  data. We benchmark Bicycle in the context of existing approaches, demonstrating
  improved recovery of simulated causal graphs and improved out-of-distribution prediction
  performance on unseen perturbations in real single-cell datasets.
