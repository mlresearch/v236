abstract: Hyperparameters play a critical role in machine learning. Hyperparameter
  tuning can make the difference between state-of-the-art and poor prediction performance
  for any algorithm, but it is particularly challenging for structure learning due
  to its unsupervised nature. As a result, hyperparameter tuning is often neglected
  in favour of using the default values provided by a particular implementation of
  an algorithm. While there have been numerous studies on performance evaluation of
  causal discovery algorithms, how hyperparameters affect individual algorithms, as
  well as the choice of the best algorithm for a specific problem, has not been studied
  in depth before. This work addresses this gap by investigating the influence of
  hyperparameters on causal structure learning tasks. Specifically, we perform an
  empirical evaluation of hyperparameter selection for some seminal learning algorithms
  on datasets of varying levels of complexity. We find that, while the choice of algorithm
  remains crucial to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, hyperparameter selection
  in ensemble settings strongly influences the choice of algorithm, in that a poor
  choice of hyperparameters can lead to analysts using algorithms which do not give
  state-of-the-art performance for their data.
