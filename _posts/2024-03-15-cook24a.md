abstract: We consider the problem of efficient inference of the <em>Average Treatment
  Effect</em> in a sequential experiment where the policy governing the assignment
  of subjects to treatment or control can change over time. We first provide a central
  limit theorem for the Adaptive Augmented Inverse-Probability Weighted estimator,
  which is semiparametric efficient, under weaker assumptions than those previously
  made in the literature. This central limit theorem enables efficient inference at
  fixed sample sizes. We then consider a sequential inference setting, deriving both
  asymptotic and nonasymptotic confidence sequences that are considerably tighter
  than previous methods. These anytime-valid methods enable inference under data-dependent
  stopping times (sample sizes). Additionally, we use propensity score truncation
  techniques from the recent off-policy estimation literature to reduce the finite
  sample variance of our estimator without affecting the asymptotic variance. Empirical
  results demonstrate that our methods yield narrower confidence sequences than those
  previously developed in the literature while maintaining time-uniform error control.
