abstract: We investigate the relationship between system identification and intervention
  design in dynamical systems. While previous research demonstrated how identifiable
  representation learning methods, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), can
  reveal cause-effect relationships, it relied on a passive perspective without considering
  how to collect data. Our work shows that in Gaussian Linear Time-Invariant (LTI)
  systems, the system parameters can be identified by introducing diverse intervention
  signals in a multi-environment setting. By harnessing appropriate diversity assumptions
  motivated by the ICA literature, our findings connect experiment design and representational
  identifiability in dynamical systems. We corroborate our findings on synthetic and
  (simulated) physical data. Additionally, we show that Hidden Markov Models, in general,
  and (Gaussian) LTI systems, in particular,  fulfil a generalization of the Causal
  de Finetti theorem with continuous parameters. The projectâ€™s repository is at [github.com/rpatrik96/lti-ica](https://github.com/rpatrik96/lti-ica).
