abstract: Model interpretability plays a central role in human-AI decision-making
  systems. Ideally, explanations should be expressed using human-interpretable semantic
  concepts. Moreover, the causal relations between these concepts should be captured
  by the explainer to allow for reasoning about the explanations. Lastly, explanation
  methods should be efficient and not compromise the predictive task performance.
  Despite the recent rapid advances in AI explainability, as far as we know, no method
  yet fulfills these three desiderata. Indeed, mainstream methods for local concept
  explainability do not yield causal explanations and incur a trade-off between explainability
  and prediction accuracy. We present DiConStruct, an explanation method that is both
  concept-based and causal, which produces more interpretable local explanations in
  the form of structural causal models and concept attributions. Our explainer works
  as a distillation model to any black-box machine learning model by approximating
  its predictions while producing the respective explanations. Consequently, DiConStruct
  generates explanations efficiently while not impacting the black-box prediction
  task. We validate our method on an image dataset and a tabular dataset, showing
  that DiConStruct approximates the black-box models with higher fidelity than other
  concept explainability baselines, while providing explanations that include the
  causal relations between the concepts.
